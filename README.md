## Developing

This app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

### A note about code quality

This is a nights & weekends side project. My guiding principle while building
this app is: **have fun** :smile:. As a result, there are some rough patches in
this code base that would require non-fun refactoring work that I simply haven't
prioritized. This is not representative of my professional work! A much more
representative example is [my list of open-source contributions to
GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged&author_username=nfriend).

### Running

```sh
flutter run
```

See the [Flutter
documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/devtools/cli) for more
information about running and debugging a Flutter application locally.

_Note:_ I've mostly been using the [VSCode
plugin](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/devtools/vscode) to launch
and debug the app.

### Building a release

First, bump the version in [`pubspec.yaml`](pubspec.yaml).

#### Android

```sh
flutter clean && flutter build appbundle
```

#### iOS

Make sure to replace `ABCD1234` with the app's real Apple ID.

```sh
flutter clean && flutter build ipa --dart-define=appStoreId=ABCD1234
```

### Generating gears

Gear are generated by the [`gear_generator/`](gear_generator/src/index.ts) Node
application. See the [README in that directory](gear_generator/README.md) for
more information about this process.

### Updating the launcher icon

This app uses
[`flutter_launcher_icons`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons) to
manage the app's icon for both Android and iOS.

The plugin is configured in [`pubspec.yaml`](pubspec.yaml). To re-generate the
icons, run:

```sh
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

### Toubleshooting

**The CI build is failing due a dependency problem, but locally, everything
works fine.**

Make sure the default `image` in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml) matches the
version of Flutter you are using locally:

```yml
default:
  image: cirrusci/flutter:2.1.0-12.1.pre
```

**The app store review link is not working in iOS.**

In order for the app store review link to work (in iOS), the `appStoreId`
environment variable must be set to the app's store ID.

Environment variables are passed at build-time using `--dart-define`:

```sh
flutter run --dart-define=appStoreId=ABCD1234
```

Android does not require this configuration.
