# Inspiral

Create beautiful spirals with gears.

## Developing

This app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

### Running

```sh
flutter run
```

See the [Flutter
documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/devtools/cli) for more
information about running and debugging a Flutter application locally.

_Note:_ I've mostly been using the [VSCode
plugin](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/devtools/vscode) to launch
and debug the app.

### Generating gear images

Gear images are generated by the
[`gear_generator/generate.dart`](gear_generator/generate.dart) command-line
program.

To run this program:

1. Make sure [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is installed
1. Run `./generate.dart` at a terminal

At a high level, this program will:

1. Generate an SVG image for each gear and save the results in
   `gear_generator/tmp`
1. Use Inkscape to convert the SVG images to PNGs and save the results in
   `gear_generator/tmp`
