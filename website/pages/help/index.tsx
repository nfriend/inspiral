        <h3 id="what-does-this-button-do">What does this button do?</h3>

        <p>
          If you're unsure what a button does, press and hold on the button to
          reveal a tooltip:
        </p>

        <img
          src="/help/images/tooltip.gif"
          alt="A GIF showing how to reveal a tooltip on a button"
        />

        <h3 id="selecting-a-new-pen-hole">Selecting a new pen hole</h3>

        <p>
          You can select a different hole by opening the <b>Tools</b> tab and
          pressing the first button in the top row. This will zoom in on the
          rotating gear and allow you to select any of the available holes.
          Press the button again to zoom back out.
        </p>

        <img
          src="/help/images/select-hole-button.png"
          alt="A screenshot of the 'Select hole' button"
        />

        <h3 id="rotating-the-gear-in-place">Rotating the gear in place</h3>

        <p>
          To draw a pattern multiple times with each pattern offset by a single
          tooth, press the second or third buttons in the <b>Tools</b> tab.
          These buttons rotate the gear in place by a single tooth, without
          drawing any lines.
        </p>

        <img
          src="/help/images/rotate-in-place.png"
          alt="A screenshot of the 'Rotate by one tooth' buttons"
        />

        <h3 id="using-auto-draw">Using auto-draw</h3>

        <p>
          Instead of dragging the gear yourself, you can let Inspiral do the
          hard work for you! The fourth button in the <b>Tools</b> tab will spin
          the rotating gear one full rotation (360Â°). The fifth button will spin
          until a complete pattern is drawn and the pen is back in its original
          position.
        </p>

        <img
          src="/help/images/auto-draw.png"
          alt="A screenshot of the 'Auto draw' buttons"
        />

        <p>
          To make auto-draw faster, open the <b>Additional options</b> sidebar
          and set the <b>Auto-draw speed</b> setting to "Fast".
        </p>

        <h3 id="locking-the-fixed-gear">Locking the fixed gear</h3>

        <p>
          To avoid accidentally moving the fixed gear, press the button with the
          lock icon in the <b>Tools</b> tab. This will lock the fixed gear in
          place, and you will no longer be able to move or rotate it. To unlock
          the gear, press the button again.
        </p>

        <img
          src="/help/images/fixed-gear-lock.png"
          alt="A screenshot of the 'Lock fixed gear' button"
        />

        <h3 id="rotating-the-fixed-gear">Rotating the fixed gear</h3>

        <p>
          The fixed gear can be rotated using a two-finger gesture. Note that
          both fingers must be touching the fixed gear. For small gears, it may
          help to zoom in on the gear before attempting to rotate it.
        </p>

          Using fixed gear "snap points"
          <VersionIndicator version="1.1.0" />
        </h3>

        <p>
          When you begin moving the rotating gear, a small blue "snap point" is
          added to the canvas.
        </p>

        <img
          src="/help/images/snap-point.jpg"
          alt="A gear with a 'snap point' at its center"
        />

        <p>
          While moving the fixed gear around the canvas, the fixed gear will
          "snap" to these points to allow for perfect alignment with previous
          drawings.
        </p>

        <p>
          To turn snap points on or off, press the final button in the{' '}
          <b>Tools</b> tab.
        </p>

          - or if you install the app on a second device - you will need to
